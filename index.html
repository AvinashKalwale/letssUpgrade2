    <h1 id="h1">What is Tea?</h1>
    <p id="p">Welcome to the Beginners course of TeaClass. This training program is designed to give you the foundation of information that will allow you to begin your journey through the world of tea. In this first lesson, we will define tea and examine the most common varieties.

       <h2>What is tea?</h2> 
     <div id="box"> <p> That's a good question! Tea is the second most consumed drink in the world, surpassed only by water. An often-surprising fact to tea novices is that all teas (Black, Green, Oolong, White, and Pu'erh) come from the same plant. The scientific name of this versatile plant is Camellia sinensis (it's actually related to the lovely camellia flowers seen in botanical gardens and landscapes). Camellia sinensis is a sub-tropical, evergreen plant native to Asia but is now grown around the world. The tea plant grows best in loose, deep soil, at high altitudes, and in sub-tropical climates. So, in short, "tea" is anything derived from the Camellia sinensis plant. Anything else, while sometimes called "tea", is more accurately referred to as an herbal tea or tisane. Tisanes include chamomile, rooibos and fruit teas. We'll learn about those in a minute.</p>
